This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the stock performance of NVDA (Nvidia), TSLA (Tesla), and the S&P 500 index, examining their price trends, volatility, and inter-relationships. 
It further investigates the connection between key economic indicators—including treasury bond yields, interest rates, and income levels—and stock market behavior. 
Through data visualization and statistical analysis, the project aims to uncover patterns in stock price movements and how broader economic conditions may influence market performance.
